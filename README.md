Description: 
The Stones Game is a two-player competitive game where players take turns removing stones from three different piles.
Each player can choose to pick up 1 to 3 stones from a single pile. The objective is to avoid being the player who picks
up the last stone, as that player will lose the game. The game continues until all the piles are empty. It requires strategy
and decision-making to outsmart your opponent and emerge as the victor.
